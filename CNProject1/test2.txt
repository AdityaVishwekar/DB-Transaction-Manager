First, thanks for using We the People. In order to get information to respond to your request, we consulted with folks from the Department of Homeland Security -- the agency that administers the OPT STEM program. Here's what we can share:

For more than 200 years, the United States has welcomed immigrants and refugees from around the world into our nation, enhancing our diversity, culture, and economy. Today, many individuals contributing to the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields are immigrants or refugees, and research indicates that skilled immigrants make outsized contributions to innovation and entrepreneurship, which helps grow our economy and create jobs for all Americans. That is why the President has consistently advocated for commonsense comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would help certain foreign students who graduate with STEM degrees to stay here and contribute to our economy by providing these individuals with avenues to obtain lawful permanent residence (or "green cards").
